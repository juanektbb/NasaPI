# NasaPI
NasaPI is a simple UI of the Astronomy Picture of the Day API of Nasa. Featured by its own date finder and sorted gallery, this is React.js app.

The most highlighting outcome of this project is that I built it without the traditional command `create-react-app`, but instead I configured every file and adquired at least the basic knowledge of ESLint, Webpack and Babel
